# PRIMM: 1+1 = 11?

## Predict
Answer the following questions *without running the repo**.

1. What does this program output?
    > It outputs 1+1=11

2. If the user intended on outputting the sum of two numbers, does this program accomplish the purpose? Why/why not?
    > No, because 1+1 is not 11, meaning that it will provide false answers

## Run
Run the program. 

1. What does the program output. Refer to what numbers you entered and what you got back.
    > It takes 2 numbers and puts them together like 2+1 would be 21 instead of 3 and 0+2 would be 02 


## Investigate
1. Add a single-line comment above each major chunk of code to explain what is happening.
2. Read about the concept of [string concatenation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_string_concatenation.asp). Explain in your own words below what it is and how it relates to this program.
    > In the string concentation site I see that they use two variables and add the two variables which fuses the two together and prints out a text. Like x= python is  y= awsome and x+y=z and print z which would print python is awsome. In our code it is kind of the same just that we ask the user for the input and then fuse the two together.

3. Read about the [`int()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_int.asp) and [`float()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_float.asp) functions in Python. What do they do? How can they help this program?

## Modify
1. Change the program using what you learned so that it adds two numbers you enter.
2. Try entered a non-numeric value. What happens? What kind of error is this (refer to our error types).
    > your answer

## Make
1. Add more lines of code to perform other math operations with the numbers you entered and print out the results. Try the following operators. 
    - `-`
    - `*`
    - `**`
    - `/`
    - `//`
    - `**`
    - `%`

2. Can you figure out what they do without looking them up? You might need to enter multiple numbers to figure it out. Fill in the table below.

| Operator | Meaning |
|  :---:    |   :---:   |  
|   `+`    | Addition |
|   `-`    | your answer |
|   `*`    | your answer |
|   `/`    | your answer |
|   `//`    | your answer |
|   `**`    | your answer |
|   `%`    | your answer |
